# larv_datasets

The datasets are used to conduct a series of trace-driven evaluations for our proposed learning-based framework, _Learning-based Automated Reconfiguration for vRANs (LARV)_. The detail experiment setups and how the datasets are collected and utilized can be found in the article:

Contents:

- data.  Measurement traces that show the relations between the traffic demands and computing resources in platform A and B. Platform A: data_milan. Platform B: data_milan2.

- topology. We consider a realistic MEC-based Milan topology (N1) and a synthetic topology (N2) generated using the Waxman algorithm. N1: milan21.pickle or milan21.json. N2: waxman21.pickle or waxman21.json
